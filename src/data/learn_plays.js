            receiver to have an open space to cut into, the other five receivers have to stay out of the way. 
            Knowing who will cut and who will stay requires the players to have a good awareness of one another. 
            The simplest way of cutting is for the person on the front of the stack to cut first, and then the 
            second and so on until the disc is received.`,

            and the next 2 look to extend this force from 3m away. The other 4 down field players look to mark 
            an area, each tracking offensive players who come into their area.`,
